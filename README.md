Fridge Inventory Tracking App for IOS

This app was designed in an attempt to reduce personal food waste as I get used to cooking for myself this year. It connects to the https://upcdatabase.org API to allow efficient data entry through Barcode Scanning to quickly retrieve item names. API keys and personal databases are saved on each individual's device allowing for quick data retrieval and data safety.

FEATURES:

Searching -
Users can search their items to check if they have it in their fridge which shopping or looking for recipes.

Expiration Date Filter -
Users can filter by expiration date to ensure they are not wasting food.

Quick Deletion - 
Users can simply swipe left to use one of the items and swipe right to edit items or delete them all.
